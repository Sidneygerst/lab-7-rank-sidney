Hi this is sidney and Daphne is the Dancing Queen now



Collaborator: This is the Dancing Queen, and I'm going to make some kick-ass histograms
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")


#Histogram made
kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ Gender)

kermit_hist




```

Creator: doing some dope ass rank-based tests
```{r}
#is there a signifigant difference in pre-talk Kermit scores for males and females?

#H0: No

#unpaired: Mann-Whitney U, use wilcox.test for both this and Wilcoxen test, but just say paired

mwu_kermit <- kermit %>%
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)

mwu_kermit

#no sig diff yo


```
